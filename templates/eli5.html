            <h1>Explain Like I'm Five</h1>
            <p>String theory is a big idea about how the universe works. Here's the simple version.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>What is String Theory?</h2>
            <p>Imagine everything in the universe is made of tiny, tiny strings that vibrate. Different vibrations act like different particles, kind of like how different notes come from the same guitar string.</p>
            <p>To make the math work, string theory says the universe has extra hidden dimensions that are curled up very small. The shapes of those hidden dimensions matter a lot.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>What Are Calabi-Yau Manifolds?</h2>
            <p>Calabi-Yau manifolds are fancy names for possible shapes of those hidden dimensions. There are a huge number of possible shapes, and each one could change what physics looks like.</p>
            <p>Think of them as different blueprints for how the hidden dimensions are folded.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>What Does upg-strings Do?</h2>
            <p>upg-strings is a search engine for these shapes. It uses machine learning to rank which shapes are most promising for researchers, then verifies the top results.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It scans lots of candidates quickly</li>
                <li>It finds the top few that look special</li>
                <li>It checks those results to make sure they are correct</li>
                <li>It exports files scientists can analyze in other tools</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Why Does This Help?</h2>
            <p>There are too many possible shapes to check one by one. upg-strings helps scientists focus on the best candidates first, which saves a huge amount of time and computing power.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>What is Information Density?</h2>
            <p>We recently added a new way to rank shapes called "Information Density." Think of it like rating how efficiently a shape stores information.</p>
            <p>Imagine you have a suitcase (the shape) and you want to pack as much stuff (physics) into it as possible without it bursting. Some shapes are better "packers" than others.</p>
            <p>We measure this using several things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hodge Entropy</strong> - How balanced is the shape? Like checking if your suitcase is packed evenly.</li>
                <li><strong>Topological Efficiency</strong> - How much curvature fits per "handle" on the shape.</li>
                <li><strong>Flux Density</strong> - How many possible "configurations" of energy can live in this shape. Based on real physics formulas.</li>
                <li><strong>Vacuum Stability</strong> - How likely is this shape to give us a stable universe, not one that falls apart.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>What's the Tadpole?</h2>
            <p>In string theory, there's a rule called the "tadpole constraint" (yes, really!). It's like a budget limit.</p>
            <p>When you add energy sources (called fluxes and branes) to a shape, they have to balance out. The tadpole number (χ/24) tells you how much "budget" you have to work with.</p>
            <p>Shapes with more budget can hold more configurations, but they also need more things to balance out. It's a tradeoff!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Can I Customize the Ranking?</h2>
            <p>Yes! If you're a researcher, you can adjust how much weight each factor gets in the ranking. Maybe you care more about vacuum stability than entropy - you can tune that.</p>
            <p>Use the <code>/api/info-density/weights</code> endpoint to set your own weights, or export the raw physics data and run your own analysis.</p>
